title: About

I am a programmer, architect, team lead, agile coach and certified Scrum Master from the UK. I work as a .NET Sofware Development Consultant at [Solidsoft Reply](http://www.reply.com/solidsoft-reply/en/). I help teams write clean, well-crafted code, create great products and deliver them regularly and reliably.

Over the past 15 years I have helped create software to:

*  Help audit clinical care in NHS hospitals.
*  Manage planning and building control applications for UK local authorities.
*  Manage a BS7666 compliant land and property gazetteer.
*  Assist with vehicle damage estimation and manage the related insurance claims.
*  Protect e-mail users from zero-day malware attacks.
*  Help prevent falsified medicines from harming patients across the EU.

I believe in the [principles of agile software development](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html), and that practices and processes derived from them are the best ways to develop software we currently know of. I care about good software craftmanship practices like TDD, BDD, SOLID object-orientated code, domain driven design, and continuous integration and release.

The main purpose of the blog is to make me a better writer by forcing myself to write more regularly. The topics will mainly be programming bits and bobs, solutions to my IT yak shaving problems and opinions on the things I care about.

The opinions expressed here are my own, and do not represent the views of my employer.
