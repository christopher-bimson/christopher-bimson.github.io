About 6 months ago my former [Codurance](https://www.codurance.com/) colleague and [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/2J8m3qKsB9IVhV4AagaDZn?si=4c0c9f324d5442cd) co-host [:(fa-brands fa-twitter): Jorge Gueorguiev Garcia](https://twitter.com/yefoakira) asked if I wanted to do some pair programming with him on his [YouTube channel.](https://www.youtube.com/@twoormore7436/about)

Jorge kindly gave me the choice of what to do, so I plumped for some [F#](https://fsharp.org/), a language I like but very infrequently get the chance to practice. We ended up pairing on the classic [:(fa-brands fa-github): Gilded Rose](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata) refactoring kata.

Links to the full series are below. Do check out the other series (with better guests) on the channel too, and you can find Jorge's blog at [twoormore.eu](https://twoormore.eu/)
