So. It's been a while. 

I'm trying to get back into blogging and having more of an online presence generally. To get things started I have switched my [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the very nice [LoveIt](https://hugoloveit.com/) theme.

There wasn't a huge amount of content in the previous incarnation of the blog and I intend to consign the majority of it to (git) history.

I will, however, repost anything worthwhile in this, the new, rebooted version of the blog.
