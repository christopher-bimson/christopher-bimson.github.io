I'm Chris, a Technology Leader, Coach, Architect, and Software Craftsman with over 20 years of experience in creating and shipping software. These days, I focus on building world-class software delivery organisations by combining software architecture, organisational development, continuous delivery, and fostering a culture of learning.

I embrace agile software development, extreme programming, DevOps, and continuous delivery as they represent the best approaches to creating and delivering high-quality software that currently exist.

During my downtime, I enjoy tinkering with programming projects and writing about the nuanced process of making and shipping software, right here. 

Beyond software, I enjoy traveling and immersing myself in new places and cultures. I follow Cricket, supporting Somerset and England, as well as Speedway, being a fan of the (now sadly defunct) Exeter Falcons. Additionally, I relax by playing games inspired by classic Black Isle style 90's CRPGs.
