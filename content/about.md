I'm Chris, a Technology Leader, Coach, Architect, and Software Craftsman with over 20 years of experience in creating and shipping software. These days, I focus on building world-class software delivery organisations by combining software architecture, organisational development, continuous delivery, and fostering a culture of learning.

I embrace agile software development, extreme programming, DevOps, and continuous delivery because I believe they represent the best approaches to creating and delivering high-quality software that currently exist. But that doesn't mean they are the best approaches that will ever exist, and I'm always interested in learning better ways of doing things.

During my downtime, I enjoy tinkering with programming projects and writing about the nuanced process of making and shipping software, right here on this blog. 

Beyond software, I enjoy traveling and discovering new places and cultures. Their food especially. I follow Cricket, supporting Somerset and England, as well as Speedway, being a fan of the (now sadly defunct) Exeter Falcons. 

When it's raining, I relax by playing games inspired by or similar to the classic Black Isle style CRPGs from the 90's.
