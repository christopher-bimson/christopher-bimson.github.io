subtitle: Less than five minutes. Zero lines of code. No warranty.

If you are a Visual Studio Team Services user, you will probably have noticed the rollout of many new features aimed at making [Kanban a first class citizen
of the VSTS and TFS world.](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/work/kanban/kanban-basics)

If you are familar with Kanban, you will know that the cumulative flow diagram is one of the prinipal tools used to visualize the progress of work as it flows 
through a system. [VSTS has a cumulative flow diagram](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/report/guidance/cumulative-flow) and it's getting more useful 
with each release. 

It's exactly the kind of [big visible chart]() that us Agile types are fond of. Unfortunately, at the time of writing, there is no build-in widget to add
a continuous flow diagram to your team's [VSTS dashboard.]() You could use the [widget SDK] to create one. Probably. But who has time for that?
